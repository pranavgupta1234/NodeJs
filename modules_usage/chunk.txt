I have a simple TCP server that listens on a port.

var net = require("net");

var server = net.createServer(function(socket) {
    socket.end("Hello!\n");
});

server.listen(7777);

I start it with node server.js and then close it with Ctrl + Z on Mac. When I try to run it again with node server.js I get this error message:

node.js:201
        throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
          ^
Error: listen EADDRINUSE
at errnoException (net.js:670:11)
at Array.0 (net.js:771:26)
at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:192:41)

Am I closing the program the wrong way? How can I prevent this from happening?

Probably worth adding that Ctrl-Z suspends a command on *NIX, and doesn't close it. If you type fg after Ctrl-Z, you'll be back where you left off. So your earlier node is still running. Watch out if you're doing this for other commands too! – ruffin Nov 11 '16 at 16:37

To end the program, you should be using Ctrl + C. If you do that, it sends SIGINT, which allows the program to end gracefully, unbinding from any ports it is listening on.

Ctrl + C does not work for me. Only ^C gets typed into the console, and program does not exits. – Eleeist May 9 '12 at 19:21


@Eleeist, What are you using as a terminal? It works great for me. – Brad May 9 '12 at 19:22

@Eleeist, You've probably remapped your keys or something. Ctrl+C works fine. In any case, that's a separate issue from your real problem. You should post a "Ctrl+C doesn't work" question over at SuperUser.com. – Brad May 9 '12 at 19:31

@jt0dd You could always kill -9, but I wouldn't. Are you actually sure your application is still the one keeping ports open? I've never had that problem. As soon as my application ends, the connections are always immediately terminated. I would use netstat to determine if your app or something else is lingering on that port. – Brad Jul 10 '14 at 19:52

I faced to this problem when I was using keyboard type on other language. Be sure your mac input language is English – Fa.Shapouri Dec 28 '16 at 17:07

Ctrl+Z suspends it, which means it can still be running.

Ctrl+C will actually kill it.

you can also kill it manually like this:

ps aux | grep node

Find the process ID (second from the left):

kill -9 PROCESS_ID

This may also work

killall node

ctrl+c will work but none of these command will work for me. I don't know why ? And I'm looking for command line solution – angry kiwi Aug 26 '12 at 3:59

killall node works for me :D – Joel Murphy Apr 9 '13 at 21:42

Be careful with killall node, you might kill process you wouldn't want to kill if they match "node" – Samuel Bolduc Jul 17 '13 at 17:21


you may want to move up killall nodein your answer since that is really the easiest and most reliable option (as long as you're ok with killing all instances) – Boern Jan 24 '16 at 14:42

'killall' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. Am i missing something? – Ayyash Nov 8 '16 at 8:42

Or alternatively you can do all of these in one line:

kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '\snode\s' | awk '{print $2}')

You can replace node inside '\snode\s' with any other process name.

At that point, you could just use killall. – Brad Dec 7 '14 at 15:36

killall didn't work for me, but this did – FabianCook Dec 8 '14 at 1:20

alternately, you can always try: ps -ef | grep "node" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 – frymaster Jul 16 '15 at 22:20

If you are running Node.js interactively (the REPL):

Ctrl + C will take back you to > prompt then type:

process.exit()

or just use Ctrl + D.

$ sudo killall node in another terminal works on mac, while killall node not working:

$ killall node
No matching processes belonging to you were found

Though this is a late answer, I found this from NodeJS docs:

    The 'exit' event is emitted when the REPL is exited either by receiving the .exit command as input, the user pressing <ctrl>-C twice to signal SIGINT, or by pressing <ctrl>-D to signal 'end' on the input stream. The listener callback is invoked without any arguments.

So to summarize you can exit by:

    Typing .exit in nodejs REPL.
    Pressing <ctrl>-C twice.
    pressing <ctrl>-D.
    process.exit(0) meaning a natural exit from REPL. If you want to return any other status you can return a non zero number.
    process.kill(process.pid) is the way to kill using nodejs api from within your code or from REPL.

If you want to stop your server with npm stop or something like this. You can write the code that kill your server process as:

require('child_process').exec(`kill -9 ${pid}`)
